# Customer_Segmentation

Customer segmentation is the practice of dividing customers into groups based on similarities in their behavior and characteristics. This project focuses on performing unsupervised clustering of customer records from a groceries firm's database. The primary objectives are:

- To optimize marketing strategies by tailoring products and services to the distinct needs and behaviors of customer segments.
- Use this for target marketing and promotions to specific group of customers effectively.

### Methodology

The project follows these main steps:

1) Data Cleaning: Outliers, missing values, and categorical variables are addressed to ensure data quality.

2) Feature Engineering: New features are created to capture important aspects of customer behavior.

3) Dimensionality Reduction: Techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) may be used to reduce the number of features.

4) Clustering: K-means clustering is applied to create customer segments. The number of clusters is determined through analysis.

5) Customer Profiling: Insights are extracted from each cluster, profiling customers based on various factors.
